# Implement a customer processing project.
Customer processing is when we process large-scale customers into the database, and
we store the data of the customer .by using this user store customer from a large-scale
data file, which needs to store in the system database in an optimized way and very fast
to manage easily. You have to implement a process by which the user can process the
file easily and store customer data.

# Expected Works to be Done
1. you have to process a file of more than 1 million customers
2. have to store customers in the database table
3. You have to filter duplicate, and invalid customers based on their phone
   number and email, only valid customers will be stored in the table.
4. You have to store all invalid customers in another separate table.
5. After storing those data in the table, you have to export the invalid and
   valid customers into separate files.
6. After exporting those you have to share those exported files with us.
7. For valid customers, you have to export those files in a batch of files
   including 100k customers with each file.
8. Have to share the total process execution time for exporting files.
9. Project deployment documentation
10. implements service and algorithm for file data processing and storing
    those data and exporting the files with customer data.
11. You must have to implement a multi thread process for your full process.
    
# Notes
    ● You can not use any third-party library.
    ● You must follow the code standard and proper method definition based on
    process action.
    ● Code documentation is preferable.
    ● The customer's phone number & email from the file must be validated in your
    process.
    ● Some examples of valid us phone number format
    555-555-5555, (555)555-5555, (555) 555-5555, 555 555 5555, 5555555555, 1 555 555 5555
